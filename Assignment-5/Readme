1. Develop a menu driven program for the following operations on a Singly Linked
List.
(a) Insertion at the beginning.
(b) Insertion at the end.
(c) Insertion in between (before or after a node having a specific value, say 'Insert a
new Node 35 before/after the Node 30').
(d) Deletion from the beginning.
(e) Deletion from the end.
(f) Deletion of a specific node, say 'Delete Node 60').
(g) Search for a node and display its position from head.
(h) Display all the node values.


2. Write a program to count the number of occurrences of a given key in a singly linked
list and then delete all the occurrences.
Input: Linked List : 1->2->1->2->1->3->1 , key: 1
Output: Count: 4 , Updated Linked List: 2->2->3.


3. Write a program to find the middle of a linked list.
Input: 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 3


4. Write a program to reverse a linked list.
Input: 1->2->3->4->NULL
Output: 4->3->2->1->NULL
